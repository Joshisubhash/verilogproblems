This repository contains Verilog problems and their solutions designed to improve hands-on RTL design skills.

It contains collection of Verilog-based RTL designs covering a range of digital design topics such as counters, finite state machines (FSMs), shift registers, and more.

Each module includes:
- Clean Verilog RTL implementation in `file.v`
- Simulation testbench in `file_test.v`
- Waveform and schematic screenshots documented in `all_result.md`

##  Tools Used

- Vivado - For synthesis, simulation, and schematic generation

##  Goal

To practice and demonstrate Verilog fundamentals through small, clean modules—targeted toward digital design and VLSI roles.
